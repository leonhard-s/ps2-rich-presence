If you encounter any issues using PS2RPC or would like to suggest a new feature or change, feel free to get in touch via the repository [issues](https://github.com/leonhard-s/ps2-rich-presence/issues).

Please also consider lack of clarity or undocumented features when creating issues. Using this application should be as simple as launching the game itself, and any improvement to make the app clearer and more intuitive to use is worth discussing.
